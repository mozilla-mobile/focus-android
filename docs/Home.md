# Firefox Focus for Android

> Browse like no one’s watching. The new Firefox Focus automatically blocks a wide range of ads and online trackers — from the moment you launch it to the second you leave it. Easily erase your history, passwords and cookies, so you won’t get followed by things like unwanted ads.
