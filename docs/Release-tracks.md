We have three public release tracks for Focus/Klar:

* **Production**: That's the version everyone sees on Google Play. We rollout releases gradually in stages.

* **Beta**: This track is for Beta builds. We use this track to test builds with a wider audience and to uncover problems/crashes that may prevent us from releasing the build. We may push multiple releases to this track until we feel positive about publishing to the *production* track.

* **Nightly**: We publish automated builds on this track every 24 hours. Those builds reflect the latest state of the repository (master). This track allows users to experience the newest Firefox Focus/Klar innovations in an unstable environment and provide feedback on features and performance to help determine what makes the final release. Nightly builds can be unstable and contain incomplete or defect features.
